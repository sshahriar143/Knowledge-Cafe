                <h2 className='text-2xl font-semibold'>Props vs State</h2>
                <p>1.State can not accessible to other components but props can accessible from child component</p>
                <p>2.State can be change but props can not change (read only)</p>

                In this example, the value of count is displayed in a paragraph tag. When the button is clicked, the setCount function updates the value of count by adding 1 to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                So, in summary, useState allows you to add state to functional components by declaring a state variable and a function to update it. You can then use the state variable in your JSX, and React will automatically re-render the component when its value changes.

                <h2 className='text-2xl font-semibold'>Purpose of useEffect()</h2>
                <p>It allows us to execute some code after rendering our component, such as updating the DOM, fetching data from an API.</p>

                <h2 className='text-2xl font-semibold'>How does react works ?</h2>
                <p>React simplifies the process of building user interfaces by breaking down the UI into small, reusable components. React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI by only re-rendering components that have changed, resulting in a fast and responsive user experience.</p>
